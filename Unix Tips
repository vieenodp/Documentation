How to combile two files line by line

1. paste file1.txt file2.txt > fileresults.txt

2. awk works better as it does not add new line while joining the 2 files.

awk 'BEGIN {OFS=" "}{
  getline line < "temp.sh"
  print $0,line
} ' file1.txt

3. uniq command does not work properly without sort command. 
e.g. Command cat output.csv | grep "not" | sort | uniq  work properly but 
     cat output.csv | grep "not" | uniq does not work 

4. While using find command , if you want the result as only file names and not the path then - 
   find /dir1 -type f -printf "%f\n"

5. Rename the files in a directory ( recusrively ) by replacing one word 
   for f in `find . -name *.XML.gz`; do mv "$f" "`echo $f | sed "s/CFGDATA/CFGDATA$i/"`" ;$((i++)); done
