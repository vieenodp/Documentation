How to combile two files line by line

1. paste file1.txt file2.txt > fileresults.txt

2. awk works better as it does not add new line while joining the 2 files.

awk 'BEGIN {OFS=" "}{
  getline line < "temp.sh"
  print $0,line
} ' file1.txt

3. uniq command does not work properly without sort command. 
e.g. Command cat output.csv | grep "not" | sort | uniq  work properly but 
     cat output.csv | grep "not" | uniq does not work 

4. While using find command , if you want the result as only file names and not the path then - 
   find /dir1 -type f -printf "%f\n"

5. Rename the files in a directory ( recusrively ) by replacing one word 
   This example finds all *.XML.gz files and renames the CFGDATA to CFGDATA1 , CFGDATA2 etc.

   for f in `find . -name *.XML.gz`; do mv "$f" "`echo $f | sed "s/CFGDATA/CFGDATA$i/"`" ;$((i++)); done

6. Move the renamed files to one single directory from all all sub directories 
   for f in `find . -name *.XML.gz`; do mv $f temp/; done

7. Extract the numbers from the string 
   grep -o '\<[0-9][0-9]*\>' example.txt 

8. Extract a tag's value from a xml file which is a digit only value. Sort and unique values.
   grep measInfoId A20230801.1945+0100-2000+0100_WMS103.xml | grep -o '\<[0-9][0-9]*\>' | sort | uniq

9. Merge two files , excluding duplicates.
   sort file1 file2 | uniq 
   sort -u file1 file2

10. To find each entry of file1 in file2 and print found and not found entries. 
    for i in `cat file1.txt`;do count=`egrep  -w $i file2.txt |wc -l`;if [ $count == "0" ];then echo  "$i---Not found in Master counter file";else echo "$i- found in the file,";fi;done  > output.txt
